# Liked List

1. Linked List 找倒数第K个节点

High Level Idea

- Initialize two pointers i and j pointing to the head
- Move j k steps forward
- Move both i and j one step forward at a time until j is out of bound

2. Recursion 递归

面试时可能会刻意考察recursion是否理解
Bottom up recursion 3steps:

- Ask for subproblem result
- Do something in current level of recursion
- Return result

More examples:

- Delete Node in a Linked List(237)
- Linked List Cycle (141)
- Reverse Linked List II (92)
- Reverse Nodes In k-Group(25)
